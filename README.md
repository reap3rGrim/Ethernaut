## **Ethernaut**

A much light implementation of the ethernaut challenges, with the bare minimum contracts, deploy scripts and scripts for exploitation.

**Installation**

-   Git Clone this repo
-   Run yarn in the root directory

**Playing**

-   Deploy the contracts using
    `yarn hardhat deploy`

-   You can run the exploit scripts or make your own tests or scripts to play the game

**Note**

All levels in this repo are NOT solved. This was just an attempt to create a local implementation of them.

-   For some other levels, remix was enough.

-   Some contracts have default values left blank as it's easier to implement them through remix or directly, it would be unnecessarily complicated to do that here. Feel free to try to edit the values yourself

-   There may be missing contracts, as said this was made long ago just to locally implement the ethernaut challenges
